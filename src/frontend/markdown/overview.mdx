Lightning Jackpot is a provably fair gaming platform.

"In online gambling provably fair describes an algorithm which can be analyzed and verified for fairness on the part of the service operator. "

### Open source!

The rabbit hole got quite deep! We ended up creating a Provably Fair Framework and are happy to share it with everybody.

You can find and read more about it <a href="https://github.com/matthewlilley/provably-fair-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

### RNG

Every game on Lightning Jackpot uses a RNG (Random Number Generator), a number of inputs are passed to it, which are transformed into a
number of outputs.

### Inputs

Inputs are composed of a Seed Pair (Server Seed & Client Seed) and Nonce (Instance Identifier). The Client Seed, None and SHA256 hash of the Server Seed are known publically before a game outcome is determained.

### Seed Pair Lifecycle

<div style={{
  padding: '12px 24px 12px',
}}>
  <Timeline>
    <Timeline.Item>A Seed Pair (Server Seed and Client Seed) is genrated.</Timeline.Item>
    <Timeline.Item>A SHA256 Hash of the Server Seed (Server Hash) and Client Seed is commited to <Link href={{ pathname: '/provably-fair', query: { tab: 'seeds' } }} children={<a>Active</a>} shallow={true} />.</Timeline.Item>
    <Timeline.Item style={{paddingBottom: 0}}>After 24 hours, a new Seed Pair is generated, and the Server Seed for the previous day is commited to <Link href={{ pathname: '/provably-fair', query: { tab: 'seeds' } }} children={<a>Previous</a>} shallow={true} />.</Timeline.Item>
  </Timeline>
</div>

Once you have the complete Seed Pair, you can verify two things.

Firstly, you can SHA256 hash the Server Seed and verify it matches the Server Seed Hash commited on the previous day.

Secondly, you can use the Seed Pair to verify the outcome of any game instance which used that Seed Pair.
